# Beer Pong Sense Test #
#### A functionality demonstration of the technology used in Beer Pong Sense ####

Beer Pong Sense is a fully RGB-lit capacitive-sensing set of modular beer pong table boards. This test project is the little brother.

This is a 1x4 Sensor Test

This test board has a single horizontal row of 4 capacitive sensors. This will allow basic functionality testing by ensuring:
- One cup can be sensed at multiple locations
- Two cups can be sensed and distinguished

The project utilizes AVR microcontrollers making use of ATMEL's QTouch Library to provide capacitive sensing.

UPDATES:

20120421 - Restarted work on the project after a long hiatus (military deployments make engineering difficult).
20120422 - Began working BOM based on Parametric information from Atmel and my past QTouch experience. BOM will focus on parts to be used in both the test board and final design.
